Once upon a time, I went to the store to buy some bread. The bread was very tasty. However, the bakery owner overcharged me for my bread. I was very sad.

I decided to no longer frequent the bakery and set off in search of a new and improved bakery. Sadly, the town that I was in only had the one bakery. Not to be discouraged I started searching online for new and improved bakeries nearby.

I found a bakery that was 30 minutes away by car. The reviews were really good so I figured I would give it a try. I hopped in my car and drove for 30 minutes to visit the bakery. When I got there, I bought 1 loaf of bread. The cost of the bread was cheaper than my old bakery. I headed back home.
